This is just an experimental approach to convert DNA sequences into images or arrays. Additionally, I used generated-images to train a deep learning algorithm by this hope that model can identify DNA feature without any data labeling.

## Using Autoencoders to Discover Patterns in DNA Sequences: Implications for Genetics and Computer Vision

#### Introduction:

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a complex polymer composed of four nucleotide bases - adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G) - that repeat throughout the genome, forming codes that are essential for all cellular activities. While some of these codes can be read and translated into proteins, which perform various functions in the body, only a small portion of the genome consists of coding sequences; the rest has structural and regulatory roles.

Despite the importance of DNA sequences, identifying their features can be a challenging and resource-intensive task. One promising approach is to use artificial neural networks, such as autoencoders, to identify patterns in DNA sequences that can help us better understand their function and potential links to genetic conditions. Autoencoders can learn to represent complex data, like DNA sequences, in a lower-dimensional space, making them a useful tool for discovering patterns and features that may be difficult to identify by other means.

By exploring the ability of autoencoders to recognize patterns in DNA sequences, we can gain insights into the organization and structure of these sequences. For example, genomic duplications, deletions, rearrangements, and mutations are the main sources of genomic diversification during species evolution. The footprint of these events can be observed as repetitive patterns throughout the genome, some of which remain intact under evolutionary pressure and are recognized by different DNA-binding proteins. Autoencoders may be able to identify these patterns and provide us with a deeper understanding of gene regulation and chromatin biology.

## Questions:
Can an autoencoder identify different patterns in DNA sequences when they are transformed into small images? 

If so, will the identified features result in a homogeneous or heterogeneous distribution of patterns, and how many dense areas of patterns are likely to be identified? 

I think answering these questions could provide valuable insights into both biological and computational systems, potentially leading to new discoveries and breakthroughs in genetics and computer vision.

## Advantages of using autoencoder instead of directly applying PCA
The advantage of using an autoencoder instead of directly applying PCA to the data lies in its ability to learn more complex, non-linear representations of the data. PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction technique that seeks to find the orthogonal linear combinations of the original features that capture the most variance in the data. However, in many real-world datasets, the underlying structure may be more complex and non-linear, and PCA may not be able to capture all of the important features in the data.

Autoencoders, on the other hand, are neural networks that can learn non-linear feature representations by encoding the input data into a lower-dimensional latent space, and then decoding it back into its original form. This allows the autoencoder to capture more complex, non-linear relationships between the features in the data.

In addition, autoencoders can also be used for tasks such as denoising or inpainting, which can help to improve the quality of the input data and further enhance the performance of downstream analysis methods such as clustering.

Therefore, while PCA is a simple and widely used method for dimensionality reduction, autoencoders can be a more powerful alternative when dealing with complex, non-linear datasets.
